ESLint-plugin-lean-imports
===================

[![Travis Build Status][build-badge]][build]

Make sure your imports only import the bits you need. Named imports actually import the entire library. So for example, this imports *all* of react-bootstrap:

`import {Tab} from 'react-bootstrap'`

In contrast, the direct import style only imports the specifically imported item:

`import Tab from 'react-bootstrap/lib/Tab';`

To avoid unnecessary bloating your bundle, this linting rule forbids the use of the named import style above, for the libraries that you specify in the configuration.

# Installation

Install [ESLint](https://www.github.com/eslint/eslint) either locally or globally.

    npm install eslint

If you installed `ESLint` globally, you have to install lean-imports plugin globally too. Otherwise, install it locally.

    npm install eslint-plugin-lean-imports

The rules are specifically written to target ES6 JavaScript, so you'll want to
use the [babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint) parser.

# Configuration

Add `plugins` section and specify ESLint-plugin-lean-imports as a plugin.

```json
{
  "parser": "babel-eslint",
  "plugins": [
    "lean-imports"
  ]
}
```

Finally, enable all of the rules that you would like to use.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "lean-imports/import": [1, [
        "lodash",
        "react-bootstrap"
    ]]
  }
}
```

# List of supported rules

The rules prevent from importing the whole library at once.

Here are the supported libraries:

* [import](docs/rules/import.md) Prevent an array of library from being completely imported
