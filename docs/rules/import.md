## Rule Details

The second parameter takes an array of the name of the library you want to test against (Only takes strings currently).

With the following config
```
"lean-imports/import": [1, ["lodash"]]

```js
import _ from 'lodash';

```js
import { default as something } from 'lodash';

```js
import find from 'lodash/collection/find';
```
